**Autodesk Python API**

This is an upload of the Autodesk API Library to aid in developing scrips and Add Ins for Fusion 360 in a virtural environment.
This API Code is created, owned, and maintained by Autodesk Inc. and presented without warranty or support.

The most current version of this API can be found in *"C:\Users\[YOUR USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\Autodesk Fusion 360\API"*

I will be working through the API examples and doing my best to comment and explain the usage to aid in others learning of the autodesk Add-In and Script API
